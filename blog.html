                <br>
                <p> For the first week i worked on my blog, and looked at other websites that i thought might be both simple and interesting 
                    to use as a base for my blog website. I am really interested in monochromatic design, so i looked at portfolios and blogs that reflected this aesthetic,
                    such as <a class="links" href="https://timroussilhe.com/">Tim Roussilhe</a>, <a class="links" href="http://www.benmingo.com/">Ben Mingo</a>, and <a class="links" href="https://clementgrellier.fr/dolly">Clement Grellier</a>.
                    
                </p>
  
            </div>

                 <div class="another-article">
                    <h2>Week Two</h2>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/slide3/2.PNG" alt="">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                     For this exercise I decided to use the developer tools to recreate Ben Mingo’s portfolio website. I also learned how to use css tricks like java to do small hover animations.
                        I then started to develop my blog based on a wireframe i had created, which took heavy inspiration from <a class="links" href="http://www.benmingo.com/">Ben Mingo</a>.
                        I really liked the layout in particular of the website and thought that it would look excellent in a blog format with the image on the left
                        and the text on the right, making it interesting with the date and week sections being abstract.

                    <h2>Week Three</h2>

                    <br>
                    <p> My Precedents as mentioned in the first week are Tim Roussilhe, Ben Mingo, and Clement Grellier’s websites. I personally like monochromatic, minimalistic design with pops of colour throughout in meaningful places. 
                        Both Tim and Ben’s portfolio designs are quite minimalistic. They  both feature dates/numbers, and I like how there is a side bar that scrolls with you in both websites, which is where I will place the date/week/tutorial number. I also made a start 
                        on my wireframeing for the blog part of the page!

                    <br>
                    <p> I continued to code my blog and got to the point shown above. I found the overlaying text really hard to do as well as adding in CSS to get the lines to ‘load’ when the webpage is first visited or refreshedI used a section tag to group it 
                      all together so I could copy and paste my code but am 
                        having a few issues with the alignment if the following ‘copies’ of code, which I’ve been trying to debug for a while but can’t find a solution so will ask a tutor for help in the following session.
                        Picture above is showing the copied code section.

                    <p> This week I didnt work too much towards my blog, rather towards my wireframes for assignment one. For the first assignment I chose to do Calico Air as I thought it would be a more fun project to do
                      than the Vic one. I think I'm really going to enjoy making two different pieces with different design choices, at this stage I'll go for one that's more modern and professional looking 
                      and one that is a little more traditional & classic.

                    <p> Today I worked on my Figma wireframes of the blog section of the page and have a rough layout of what the home/about me page will look like.
                         I haven’t yet started my mobile prototypes but I think they will definitely be more difficult to find precedents that look good for a blog website, 
                         so before next session I will have a look at precedents for blog and how to implement my design elements into a mobile format.

                    <p> Today I finished my two wireframe pages for the website wireframes and started to do my mobile wireframes. 
                        Before next week I would like to have the blog page done and ready to be able to be able to copy the sections so I can start inputting
                         content and then be able to polish the page before moving onto the home page. This week I also finished off my wireframes and writing up my report
                         for assignment one which was a really good learning experience, I realy enjoyed this assignment!

                  <br>
                  <p> This week i finished up my wireframes for this Blog project, but after continuing to code it the blog page is turning out to be a little tricky to 
                    get to align properly, so I think I'm going to chnage the layout of this page entirely; just leave it alone for now and move on to coding up the HomePage
                    which im pretty excited about because im really happy with the layout of my wireframes. I am a little annoyed with the blog not working but its a little bit more
                    tricky to get some tutor help working from home so I'll just have to work around it and hope for a better outcome.
